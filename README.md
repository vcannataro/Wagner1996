Code that recreates the model of Wagner (1996) Does Evolutionary Plasticity Evolve?

I'm taking a "Systems Biology" course (well, journal club) and we read through Andreas Wagner's Does Evolutionary Plasticity Evolve? published in Evolution (1996). In an attempt to better understand the paper I recreated the first half of the model (before mutations start up). Should we fill in the rest?
